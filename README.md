Please open the project using Tracker.xcworkspace.

### What is this repository for? ###

* The J&J software engineering garage is looking for a way to keep track of testing devices. The goal of this challenge is to create an app that connects to a **mock** web server and performs GET and POST requests. The app must also be able to function offline and sync any offline data when it comes back online.

* This is by no means a complete solution, rather a rushed solution! But it reflects the patterns that I adopt and should provide an idea regarding my approach and my decision making.

### Setup ###
* The project was developed using XCode 8.1 and Swift 3
* Project tested on iPhone 6 running iOS 9.3.5 and iPhone 5S running iOS 10.1.1
